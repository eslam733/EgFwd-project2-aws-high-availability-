# EgFwd-project2-aws-high-availability

Developed a CloudFormation script for the deployment of a dummy application to an Apache Web Server on an EC2 instance as the final project. Created a visual diagram to aid in understanding the script and to showcase in my portfolio. Utilized hands-on experience in infrastructure as code to interpret project instructions and execute the script successfully.
